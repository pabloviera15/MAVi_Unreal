This project was inspired by:

1. MAVi (Processing Version)
https://github.com/mysunnytime/MAVi

2. MAVi (Unity Version)
https://github.com/mysunnytime/MAVi-Unity

Movement data is fascinating to data artists for its richness of expression and great potential. We explore this kind of data, for the sake of generating video sequences, and create MAVi, a new tool for video creation that allow movement data visualization, real-time manipulation, and recording.

Special thanks to the authors of the previous MAVi iterations:
